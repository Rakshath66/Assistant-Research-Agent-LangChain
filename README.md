To do:
Perfect question. Here's your **full roadmap after a working RAG Agent** like yours:

---

### ✅ PHASE 1: ✅ DONE

**You’ve completed:**

* ✅ Tool-based reasoning agent (PDF, Web, Wikipedia, Calculator)
* ✅ Streamlit UI with memory, CoT trace, and tool usage breakdown

---

### 🚀 PHASE 2: Chain-of-Tools Agent

Make your agent **auto-chain** actions like:

> “Summarize top 3 news articles about XYZ”
> ⟶ Search → Pick top links → Read + Summarize → Combine

#### 🔧 Add next tools:

* `summarize_url` (for reading links)
* `multi_url_summary` (loops through list of URLs)
* `web_search_chain` (Tavily + summarize\_url combined)

---

### 🧠 PHASE 3: Agent with Function Memory

Let your agent **remember key facts per user**, like:

> “Who is the CEO of Tesla?”
> → Even next day, it remembers your earlier query.

Use:

* LangChain’s `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory`
* Store extracted facts like Q/A or timeline

---

### 📁 PHASE 4: Document Q\&A + Chunk Tracking

Improve document tool:

* Show which **chunks** were used to generate the answer
* Highlight matching parts in the PDF
* Support **multiple PDFs at once** intelligently

---

### 🤖 PHASE 5: Tool-Using Assistant API

Package your whole logic into:

* `fastapi` or `litestar` backend
* Add endpoint: `/ask` → returns final answer + reasoning trace
* Ideal for chatbot or research assistant SaaS

---

### 🌐 PHASE 6: Assistant with Browsing + Plugin Tools

Use LangGraph (for branching logic) or LangChain Expression Language (LCEL):

* Agent decides: Search? Read? Combine? Skip?
* Add tools like `YouTubeTranscriptTool`, `Google Scholar Reader`, etc.
